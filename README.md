Multi-domain Deep Learning" is a project that uses advanced algorithms such as CNNs and GANs to solve complex problems in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing
First: Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Second: Trains MiniVGGNet on Fashion MNIST + generates a training history plot.
Third: Evaluates the resulting model and outputs a classification report.
Fourth: We creat a prediction to check the results of out training.
Lastly: Creates a montage visualization allowing us to see our results visually by Tensorboard.
